# Overview

This is the git repo for my Unity game Be Square.

This was an effort to learn the basics of Unity. I want to continue my programming career into game design and development.

Be Square is a 2D platformer game where you play as a cute little square, trying to reach the portal at the end of each level. There are dangers to avoid, as well as some friends to meet along the way.
